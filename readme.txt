- [Email Notifications](https://upstreamplugin.com/extensions/email-notifications)

= Milestones & Tasks =

Milestones & tasks help you to successfully plan, track and manage your project from start to finish. Assign tasks & milestones to users, add start & end dates, color-coded statuses, notes and progress of the tasks & milestones. You can even add your own custom fields.

= Bug Tracking & Issue Reporting =

Easily report bugs or issues as they arise and just like milestones & tasks, you can assign the bug to a user, add a status, severity of the bug, a description, due date & attach files to each individual bug.

= Project Discussion =

Avoid email trails and keep the entire discussion about your project right where it should be, within the project! Any user can add to the discussion and with the Front End Edit extension and you can also allow your clients to add to the discussion.

= Front End View =

Your clients can view the details and the progress of the project via the front end. Clients can never access the WordPress admin. Using a customized login system, you can determine which users of your client can have access to the project and also to which parts of the project they can view.

= Highly Customizable =

Well thought out settings and options, customizable templates, add your own CSS, create custom fields wherever you like, create your own statuses with whatever colors you choose plus lots more. You can even rename projects, milestones, tasks, bugs, files and clients. Prefer to rename ‘Bugs’ as ‘Issues’? Rather call a ‘Project’ a ‘Plan’ or call a ‘Client’ a ‘Customer’? Go for it!

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.4 or greater

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find UpStream documentation? =

For a Quick Start guide and more detailed instructions, please visit the official [Documentation](https://upstreamplugin.com/documentation/) page

= Where can I get support? =

You can ask for help in the [UpStream Plugin Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/upstream).

= Will UpStream work with my theme? =

Yes, UpStream works independent of any theme.

= Why doesn't the UpStream frontend look like my theme? =

UpStream does not use the existing styling of your theme. The features and the very specific nature of the plugin make it impossible to integrate into existing themes. The plugin is highly customizable though, so you can tweak it to look the way you want it to.
